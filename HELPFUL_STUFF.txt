python uses virtual environments to keep development environments clean. I've named the one we'll be using "venv". 
For consistancy, please use the venv when developing the project. :) 
To activate the venv, you can go to the top of vs code to "view", click "command pallate", 
go to "python:select interpreter", and select the one that says "venv"
